\title{A MetaTOpathway Function}
\usage{
MetaTOpathway(metaboliteDataSet, searchType, hmdb = T, pubchem = T,
  chebi = F, kegg = T, metlin = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{metaboliteDataSet}{Your metabolite data}

\item{searchType}{The type of the metabolites id such as 'name', 'kegg', 'hmdb','pubchem'}
}
\description{
This function allows you to convert your metabolites id such as names, kegg ids, pubchem ids.
into pathways. Metabolites which have no pathways will be excluded from any downstream analysis.
Make sure that you have three database files which are used for exact and fuzzy matching:
cmpd_db.rda, syn_nms_db.rda and Sijia_pathway.rda
This function was modified version of the name.match function in the below link:
